# Image hound

An application for downloading images from Flickr, Tumblr, and various image boards. Theoretically easily extensible.

## Installation

Prerequisites:

1. A working installation of Java

2. Ideally you will have associated .jar files with the Java executable in your installation of choice.

Download here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/0hf1u0fmbku7e5j/imageHound-all-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar?dl=0

Or, if you're on windows, you may find this useful, which is a version of the JAR file wrapped in an executable: https://www.dropbox.com/s/oibz7k3w4kz3jl6/ImageHound.exe?dl=0

## Usage

To start the program, download it, and assuming that your environment variables include a reference to the directory containig java, run:

`java -jar imageHound-all-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar?'

Or, if you use a GUI file manager, you can try double clicking the file. You never know. It might work.
